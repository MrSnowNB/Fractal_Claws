# Fractal Claws — Next Steps (AI-FIRST)

> **AI-FIRST DOC** — This is the canonical build queue for coding agents.
> Each step has a status, a validation gate, and a link to its full spec.
> An agent should complete the gate before marking a step DONE.
> This file is vendor-agnostic: no model names, no endpoint URLs.

## How to Use This File

1. Read the current `[ ]` step
2. Read the linked `STEP-XX-*.md` spec in `AI-FIRST/`
3. **Apply first principles before touching any file:**
   - What invariant does this step preserve?
   - What is the current state of the system?
   - What is the minimal change that moves it forward?
4. Build the code
5. Run the validation gate: `pytest tests/ -v`
6. All tests green → **write journal entry first** → then `git commit`
7. Mark step `[x] DONE` → move to next step

---

## Luffy Law — Commit Protocol

> **Journal first. Always.**

Before every `git commit`:
1. `pytest tests/` — gate must be green
2. Append entry to `logs/luffy-journal.jsonl` (valid JSON + `\n`)
3. `git add <changed files> logs/luffy-journal.jsonl`
4. `git commit -m "STEP-XX: description"`
5. `git push`

**Journal integrity is a hard invariant.** A malformed line is a violation.
Detect it → split and correct (never rewrite) → then write the new entry.

### Journal Entry Schema (STEP-07+ — includes anchor)

```json
{
  "ts": "ISO-8601",
  "step": "STEP-XX-Y",
  "action": "...",
  "status": "done",
  "files": ["..."],
  "anchor": {
    "system_state": "<one sentence: what is true about the system right now>",
    "open_invariants": ["<invariant 1>", "<invariant 2>"],
    "next_entry_point": "<STEP-XX-Y: what to do next and which file to touch first>"
  }
}
```

The `anchor` field is the **cold-start signal** — a new agent session reads ONLY
the last journal line to reconstruct system state. No spec re-reads. No file loads.
The `next_entry_point` is the single source of truth for what to do next.

**Entries written before STEP-07 do not have `anchor` — this is expected.**
Do not backfill old entries. Write new entries with `anchor` from STEP-07-A onwards.

> **Known schema debt:** The STEP-07-F journal entry has `anchor` as a flat string
> rather than the required object. This is a known shortcut. The next journal entry
> (STEP-08) must use the full object schema. Do not backfill.

## Luffy Law §2 — Scratchpad Protocol

> **Read scratchpad first. Write scratchpad often. Never re-read what is already summarized.**

The `## Scratchpad` section at the bottom of this file is Luffy's live working memory.

### Rules:

1. **ON TASK START:** Read ONLY `AI-FIRST/NEXT-STEPS.md`. If Scratchpad contains
   the current ticket ID and a recent timestamp, do **NOT** re-read journal, closed
   tickets, or any spec file. Trust the scratchpad.
2. **AFTER EACH ACTION:** Append one line to Scratchpad:
   `- [HH:MM] <action> → <result>`
3. **BEFORE COMMIT:** Update `**Status:**` and `**Next:**` fields in Scratchpad.
4. **NEVER** read a file you already summarized in Scratchpad during this session.
5. **DO NOT** read `logs/luffy-journal.jsonl` or `tickets/closed/*.yaml` if
   Scratchpad already contains the current ticket ID.

### Scratchpad Update Template:

```
## Scratchpad
**Active ticket:** STEP-XX-Y
**Status:** <one phrase: e.g. running pytest, writing journal, closing ticket>
**Last action:** [HH:MM] <action> → <result>
**Blockers:** none | <describe if any>
**Next:** <next concrete action>
```

**Violation:** If Luffy reads the same file twice in one session without writing
an update between reads, that is a Scratchpad Protocol violation. Log it.

---

## HALT Protocol

If the human says HALT:
1. Stop all active work immediately
2. Write status to `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`
3. Append one journal entry
4. Stop — do not commit, do not fix anything else

Exception: journal integrity fix is permitted during HALT documentation.

## Build Queue

### [x] DONE — Step 1: Typed Ticket I/O Bridge
**Spec:** `AI-FIRST/STEP-01-TICKET-IO.md`  
**File:** `src/ticket_io.py`  
**Gate:** `pytest tests/test_ticket_io.py -v` ✅  
**What it does:** Bridges raw-dict YAML loading with the canonical `Ticket` dataclass.
Adds schema validation, enum coercion, status aliasing, and a backward-compatible
`as_dict()` shim for incremental migration.

---

### [x] DONE — Step 2: Terminal Tool + Tool Registry
**Spec:** `AI-FIRST/STEP-02-TERMINAL-REGISTRY.md`  
**Files:** `tools/terminal.py`, `tools/registry.py`  
**Gate:** `pytest tests/test_tools.py -v` ✅ 14/14  
**What it does:**
- `tools/terminal.py` — `subprocess.run` wrapper with `DANGEROUS_PATTERNS` denylist,
  sandbox enforcement, timeout. Windows-compatible (`_shell_cmd()` join for win32).
- `tools/registry.py` — dynamic tool dispatch via `TOOL_SCHEMA`. Replaces if/elif.

---

### [x] DONE — Step 3: Wire Registry into runner.py
**Spec:** `AI-FIRST/STEP-03-RUNNER-WIRING.md`  
**Files:** `agent/runner.py`, `tests/test_runner_dispatch.py`  
**Gate:** `pytest tests/test_runner_dispatch.py -v` ✅ 11/11  
**What it does:**
- `REGISTRY = ToolRegistry()` module-level singleton in runner.py
- `parse_and_run_tools()` calls `REGISTRY.call(tool, args)` — no more if/elif
- `run_command` registered as first-class tool

---

### [x] DONE — Step 4: Trajectory Extractor
**Spec:** `AI-FIRST/STEP-04-TRAJECTORY.md`  
**File:** `src/trajectory_extractor.py`  
**Gate:** `pytest tests/test_trajectory.py -v` ✅ 13/13  
**What it does:**
- Post-run pass: reads closed ticket attempt logs
- Identifies winning execution paths (outcome=pass chains)
- Extracts tool sequence, token count, elapsed time, goal class
- Writes `skills/<goal-class>.yaml` — executable memory for reuse

---

### [x] DONE — Step 5: Full Typed Field Migration of runner.py
**Spec:** `AI-FIRST/STEP-05-RUNNER-MIGRATION.md`  
**Files:** `agent/runner.py`, `src/operator_v7.py`, `tests/test_runner_dispatch.py`  
**Gate:** `pytest tests/ -v` ✅ 151 passed, 1 skipped, 0 failed  
**What it does:** All `ticket.get()`/`ticket[key]` replaced with typed `ticket.field` access.

---

### [x] DONE — Step 6: Skill-Aware Decomposition
**Spec:** `AI-FIRST/STEP-06-SKILL-DECOMP.md`  
**Files:** `agent/runner.py`, `src/skill_store.py`, `tests/test_skill_decomp.py`  
**Gate:** `pytest tests/ -v` ✅ 167 passed, 1 skipped, 0 failed  
**What it does:**
- `src/skill_store.py` — load/match/write skill YAML with fuzzy matching (edit-distance ≤ 2)
- Cache check in `execute_ticket()` before `call_model()` — cache hit skips LLM entirely
- Audit JSONL written on cache hit with `source: skill_cache`
- `match_goal_class()` → exact then fuzzy → `load_skill()` → run `tool_sequence` via REGISTRY

---

### [x] DONE — Step 7: Anchor Journal + TicketResult + Lint Gate + Delegate Spawn
**Spec:** `AI-FIRST/STEP-07-ANCHOR-SPAWN.md`  
**Files:** `src/operator_v7.py`, `src/ticket_io.py`, `agent/runner.py`, `tools/delegate_task.py`,
`AI-FIRST/AGENT-PERSONA.md`, `tests/test_ticket_io.py`, `tests/integration/test_delegate_task.py`  
**Gate:** `pytest tests/ -v` ✅ 167 passed, 1 skipped, 0 failed  

**What was built (sub-tickets completed in order):**

| Ticket | Task | Status |
|---|---|---|
| STEP-07-A | Journal anchor schema + cold-start rule in AGENT-PERSONA.md | ✅ |
| STEP-07-B | `TicketResult` dataclass in `operator_v7.py`; migrate `ticket.result` | ✅ |
| STEP-07-C | `lint_ticket()` in `ticket_io.py`; warn on violation; log to `lint-violations.jsonl` | ✅ |
| STEP-07-D | `tools/delegate_task.py` — shared-filesystem transport; register in REGISTRY | ✅ |
| STEP-07-E | Integration test (`tests/integration/`) — skipped by default, manual ZBook run | ✅ |
| STEP-07-F | Gate (167/1/0), journal entry, commit f10a53a, push | ✅ |

**Known schema debt:** STEP-07-F journal entry has `anchor` as a flat string instead
of the spec object. STEP-08 journal entry must use the full object. Do not backfill.

---

### [x] DONE — Step 8: Lint Hard-Fail + Multi-Ticket Chain
**Spec:** `AI-FIRST/STEP-08-LINT-CHAIN.md`  
**Files:** `src/ticket_io.py`, `agent/runner.py`, `tools/delegate_task.py`, `tests/test_ticket_io.py`, `tests/test_runner_dispatch.py`  
**Gate:** `pytest tests/ -v` ✅ 178 passed, 5 skipped, 0 failed

**What was built (sub-tickets completed in order):**

| Ticket | Task | Status |
|---|---|---|
| STEP-08-A | Add `hard_fail` param to `lint_ticket()` in `src/ticket_io.py`; wire env var `FRACTAL_LINT_HARD_FAIL=1` | ✅ |
| STEP-08-B | Add `_consumes_met(ticket)` to `agent/runner.py`; gate drain loop dispatch behind deps_met AND _consumes_met; propagate produces → child context_files in `tools/delegate_task.py` | ✅ |
| STEP-08-C | Add `_detect_deadlock(deferred_paths)` DFS cycle detection to `agent/runner.py`; call it in drain() on stall; move cycle participants to tickets/failed/ with status=escalated and deadlock_reason=cycle | ✅ |
| STEP-08-D | Gate, journal (with full anchor object schema), commit, push | ✅ |

**Invariants preserved:**
- Ticket round-trips YAML without data loss
- Journal is append-only valid JSON
- `context_files` lint warns on violation — hard-fail in Step 8
- `delegate_task` is the ONLY transport layer — zero transport logic in runner.py or operator_v7.py
- Integration tests always skipped by default in full suite run

---

### [ ] Step 8E: FIFO Log Retention Policy
**Spec:** `AI-FIRST/STEP-08E-FIFO-RETENTION.md`  
**Files:** `agent/log_manager.py` (new), `settings.yaml`, `agent/runner.py`, `tests/test_log_manager.py` (new)  
**Gate:** `pytest tests/test_log_manager.py -v && pytest tests/ -v`

**What it does:**
- `agent/log_manager.py` — `prune_logs()` FIFO eviction of oldest `-attempts.jsonl` /
  `-result.txt` pairs when `logs/` exceeds `max_logs` entries
- Escalated tickets (in `tickets/failed/`) are protected — their logs are never evicted
- `min_retain` most-recent logs always survive regardless of count
- Called from `drain()` entry and `execute_ticket()` on every PASS close
- `settings.yaml` gets three new `logging:` keys: `max_logs`, `min_retain`, `keep_escalated`
- Pure file I/O — no model, no endpoint, no API key required

**Sub-tasks:**

| Sub-task | Task | Owner |
|---|---|---|
| 8E-A | Implement `agent/log_manager.py` with `prune_logs()`, `_ticket_id()`, `_get_protected_ids()` | Luffy |
| 8E-B | Add `max_logs`, `min_retain`, `keep_escalated` to `settings.yaml` under `logging:` | Luffy |
| 8E-C | Wire `prune_logs()` into `drain()` and `execute_ticket()` in `agent/runner.py` | Luffy |
| 8E-D | Run `pytest tests/test_log_manager.py -v` — all 14 tests green | Luffy |
| 8E-E | Run `pytest tests/ -v` — full suite green (1 skipped allowed) | Luffy |
| 8E-F | Write journal entry with full anchor object, commit, push | Luffy |

**Invariants to preserve:**
- `prune_logs()` never touches `tickets/` — only `logs/`
- Escalated ticket logs survive regardless of count
- `min_retain` most-recent logs always survive
- Idempotent: second call with same args returns 0 if count is within bounds
- Full test suite stays green (1 skipped for platform)

### [ ] Step 9: Graphify — Knowledge Graph Navigation Index
**Spec:** `AI-FIRST/STEP-09-GRAPHIFY.md` (not yet written)  
**Prerequisite:** STEP-08E complete. Repo must have ≥20 Python files for graph to be useful.  
**What it does:**
- `tools/graphify.py` — AST walker builds `graph/fractal-claws.json`
- `query_graph` tool in REGISTRY — replaces speculative file reads
- Nodes: FILE, FUNCTION, CLASS, TICKET, SKILL, STEP. Edges: CALLS, IMPORTS, MODIFIES, DEPENDS_ON.
- Runs on commit (pre-commit hook or CI)

---

### [ ] Step 10: ContextBudget graphify_repo() + gate — CLOSE SEQUENCE ACTIVE

> **⚠️ ACTIVE WORK — DO NOT SKIP TO STEP-11**

**Two tickets still open:** `tickets/open/STEP-10-C.yaml` and `tickets/open/STEP-10-D.yaml`  
**Fixes pushed:** `agent/context_budget.py` and `tests/test_step10_graphify.py` corrected (commit a73143a)

#### STEP-10-C close procedure (gate only — no code changes)

1. Write scratch entry: `STEP-10-C gate run — [HH:MM]`
2. Run: `pytest tests/test_step10_graphify.py -v`
3. **Expected:** `4 passed, 0 failed` — if not, STOP and open a bug ticket, do not proceed
4. Write journal entry:
   ```json
   {"ts":"<ISO>","step":"STEP-10-C","action":"gate passed","status":"done",
    "files":["tests/test_step10_graphify.py"],
    "anchor":{"system_state":"test_step10_graphify.py 4/4 passed; graphify_repo path-resolution bug fixed",
              "open_invariants":["journal append-only","no code changes in gate tickets"],
              "next_entry_point":"STEP-10-D: run full suite + verify GRAPHIFY_COMPLETE in journal + verify ctx-cache.json"}}
   }
   ```
5. Move ticket: rename `tickets/open/STEP-10-C.yaml` → `tickets/closed/STEP-10-C.yaml`, set `status: closed`
6. `git add tests/test_step10_graphify.py tickets/open/STEP-10-C.yaml tickets/closed/STEP-10-C.yaml logs/luffy-journal.jsonl`
7. `git commit -m "STEP-10-C: gate passed — 4/4 graphify tests green"`
8. `git push`

#### STEP-10-D close procedure (gate only — no code changes)

1. Write scratch entry: `STEP-10-D gate run — [HH:MM]`
2. Run: `pytest tests/ -v`
3. **Expected:** 0 failures (existing skips allowed). If any new failures appear, STOP.
4. Inspect `logs/luffy-journal.jsonl` — check if any line contains `"event": "GRAPHIFY_COMPLETE"`
   - If **present**: proceed
   - If **absent**: append this journal event now (before the STEP-10-D close entry):
     ```json
     {"ts":"<ISO>","event":"GRAPHIFY_COMPLETE","step":"STEP-10-A","files_scanned":"<N>",
      "tokens_estimated":"<N>","zone_summary":{"docs_cache":0,"ticket_context":0,"scratch_pad":0,"system_prompt":0,"response":0}}
     ```
5. Inspect `logs/ctx-cache.json` — confirm file exists and top-level key `"hashes"` is non-empty
   - If file missing or empty: open a bug ticket STEP-10-D-BUG, STOP
6. Append final close journal entry:
   ```json
   {"ts":"<ISO>","step":"STEP-10-D","action":"gate passed","status":"done",
    "files":["logs/luffy-journal.jsonl","logs/ctx-cache.json"],
    "anchor":{"system_state":"STEP-10 complete: graphify_repo working, 4 tests green, ctx-cache.json valid",
              "open_invariants":["journal append-only","ctx-cache.json hashes non-empty"],
              "next_entry_point":"STEP-11-A: add LawViolationError + assert_scratch_written() to agent/sequence_gate.py"}}
   }
   ```
7. Move ticket: rename `tickets/open/STEP-10-D.yaml` → `tickets/closed/STEP-10-D.yaml`, set `status: closed`
8. `git add tickets/open/STEP-10-D.yaml tickets/closed/STEP-10-D.yaml logs/luffy-journal.jsonl`
9. `git commit -m "STEP-10: graphify pre-scan complete — gate passed"`
10. `git push`

---

### [ ] Step 11: Luffy Law Mechanical Enforcement
**Spec:** `AI-FIRST/STEP-11-LUFFY-LAW-ENFORCEMENT.md` ✅ written  
**Prerequisite:** STEP-10-D closed ← **not yet done**  
**Files:** `agent/sequence_gate.py`, `agent/runner.py`, `tests/test_luffy_law.py` (new)  
**Gate:** `pytest tests/test_luffy_law.py -v` (6 tests) + `pytest tests/ -v` (0 failed)  

**Sub-tasks:**

| Sub-task | Task | Owner |
|---|---|---|
| 11-A | Add `LawViolationError` + `assert_scratch_written()` to `agent/sequence_gate.py` | Luffy |
| 11-B | Hook Law §1 in `execute_ticket()` before `TICKET_CLOSED` write | Luffy |
| 11-C | Hook Law §2: `SCRATCHPAD_READ` emit in `drain()` + check in `execute_ticket()` | Luffy |
| 11-D | Hook Law §3: `LAW_VIOLATION` info emit in `build_prompt()` on cache skip | Luffy |
| 11-E | Write `tests/test_luffy_law.py` — 6+ tests | Luffy |
| 11-F | Gate, journal with anchor, commit, push | Luffy |

---

## Architecture Context

```
Layer 1: CLINE (Key-Brain / Orchestrator)  — 80B coder
  Reads anchor from last journal line (cold start: 1 line only)
  Reads skills/ → skips decomposition if goal class known
  Writes YAML tickets → lint_ticket() pre-flight
  Calls delegate_task() → sleeps while child executes
  Reads TicketResult.anchor → continues chain or escalates

Layer 2: FRACTAL CLAWS (Ticket Router / Gate)  ← this repo
  Dependency graph → drain loop → deadlock detect
  Typed Ticket + TicketResult contract (ticket_io + operator_v7)
  Tool registry (REGISTRY) → dispatches to execution layer
  Trajectory extractor → writes skills/ after each pass
  Skill store → reads skills/ before decomposition
  Lint gate → warns on malformed tickets before dispatch
  Log manager → FIFO prune on drain entry + every PASS close (STEP-08E)
  Luffy Law gate → §1 hard block on TICKET_CLOSED (STEP-11)

Layer 3: OPENCLAW (Child Executor)  — A3B model
  Spawned by delegate_task() — loads only context_files from ticket
  Executes tool_sequence via REGISTRY
  Writes TicketResult to result_path (including anchor summary)
  Exits — parent reads result, continues

Layer 4: HERMES-STYLE TOOLS (Execution Layer)
  terminal, process, patch, search_files
  delegate_task (substrate abstraction)
  Every CLI binary on the machine

Substrate (ZBook POC → Liberty Mesh):
  ZBook:        shared filesystem (tickets/open/, tickets/closed/)
  Liberty Mesh: LoRa serial — Ticket.to_dict() → JSON → radio → JSON → Ticket.from_dict()
  Only tools/delegate_task.py changes per substrate
```

---

## Reproducibility Requirement

Every step must be completable on any machine with:
- Python 3.10+
- `pip install pyyaml pytest`
- No model, no endpoint, no API key required for tests
- No network access required for tests

Integration tests go in `tests/integration/` and are ALWAYS skipped by default.
Run manually: `pytest tests/integration/ -v -s --no-header`

---

## Scratchpad

**Active ticket:** STEP-10-C (gate run)  
**Status:** ready — fixes pushed, awaiting Luffy pytest run  
**Last action:** [09:51] Perplexity pushed corrected context_budget.py + test_step10_graphify.py (commit a73143a)  
**Blockers:** none — code is fixed, just needs local pytest confirmation  
**Next:** Run `pytest tests/test_step10_graphify.py -v` — expect 4 passed — then follow STEP-10-C close procedure above

> Scratchpad Protocol: update this section after every action. Never re-read
> `logs/luffy-journal.jsonl` or `tickets/closed/*.yaml` when this section is current.
